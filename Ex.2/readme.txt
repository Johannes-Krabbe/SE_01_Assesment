This Programm is written by Johannes Krabbe on the 11.05.2021
it is part of the "Dojo-Style SE_01 Assessment" at the CODE University (this is the Solution for Ex. 1 and Ex. 2)

to run this code you need Python 3.8.6

In your terminal, navigate to this folder and type "python3 main.py" the output should look something like: 

[1, 1, 1, 0]
[2, 2, 4, 2]
[2, 2, 3, 1]
[1, 2, 3, 2]

inorder to change the input open main.py and look for the variable myInput.
3x3 and 4x4 grids work as input.
if this is your input grid:
a b c d 
e f g h 
i j k l
m n o p

change myInput to this:

myInput = [[a, b, c, d] [e, f, g, h], [i, j ,k , l], [m, n, o, p]]

only enter numbers!
